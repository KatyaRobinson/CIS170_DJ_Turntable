    <h6>my story</h6>
    <article class="main_article" id="mystory-main-article">
      <p>I grew up in a very musical family. My father played saxophone with a “band of buddies” from his college days, and he is now the local high school band teacher. My mother is the singer in the family, and she is a regular lead performer in musicals with our community theater Needless to say, my three siblings and I all took music lessons. But even though I was the one who never could settle on a favorite instrument, I’m the only one who went in to the music business!<br>
        Early on, music became my thing. I could name any song on the radio and tell you not only who was singing it, but who wrote it and when. At my senior prom, I was at the turntable more than I was on the dance floor. </p>

        <p>During college, I supplemented my income by Dj-ing fraternity- and sorority-sponsored parties ad other campus events. That was cool, but I missed being part of all the action and fun that people were having at a party rocking with muisic. Let;s face it, being a DJ is the closest thing to being a rock star without having to play an instrument!
So, I started DJ Turnatable, and I haven’t stopped spinning since, I love what I do and so will you. - Dylan Jackso</p>
