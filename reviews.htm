        <p>Dylan, you were the absolute best! The music was fantastic, and the lighting effects were amazing. Your talent transformed an ordinary gym into a high-tech night club. Our students were thrilled, and even the teachers enjoyed the evening! Everyone I’ve talked to agrees that this was the best senior prom we’ve been in years. Thank you for sharing you talent with us.

      <p>We have never met a DJ who was so personable and easy to work with. You were right - you did make it all about you. We were so impressed by how smoothly our parents’ anniversary went, and the music and dancing were incredible. We’re still amazed how you were able to get the grandkids and grandparents n the dance floor at the same time. Thank you a thousand times.
